## Rails
* [vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) lets `gf` and `:Rextract` work on partials, highlights Rails functions.
* [vim-endwise](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise) automatically puts in `end`s for your` if` and `do` blocks.
* [vim-ruby-refactoring](https://github.com/ecomba/vim-ruby-refactoring) gives some IDE-like refactoring support to vim.  A favorite is `:RExtractLet` (aliased as `,rel`) which takes a local variable in a spec and makes it into a let statement. Others are `:RAddParameter`, `:RInlineTemp`, `:RConvertPostConditional`, `:RExtractConstant`, `:RExtractLocalVariable`, `:RRenameLocalVariable`, `:RRenameInstanceVariable`, `:RExtractMethod`.  They can also be accessed with the leader key followed by the capital letters in the command, so `:RAlphaBeta` becomes `,rab`.
* [test_server](https://github.com/brysgo/test_server) lets you use F9 thru F12 to run specs and report the output in vim.
* [vim-blockle](https://github.com/jgdavey/vim-blockle) lets you change a `do..end` into a `{..}` by pressing `b` with the cursor on part of the block.
